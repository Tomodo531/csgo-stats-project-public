# CSGO stats project

This is the public version of the code used to create my CSGO stats site using React. To check it out go to https://tomodo531.github.io/csgo-stats-project/.

In this project, I have used the steam API to get CSGO player statistics and visualize them using React. The statistics given are from both casual and competitive play. 

That's about it have a great day and feel free to use the code if you want to.
